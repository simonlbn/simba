Software architecture
---------------------

Below is a picture of all packages and their relation to the
hardware. At the bottom is the hardware. On top of the hardware is the
kernel and drivers packages, which exports a hardware independent
interface that other packages and the user application can use. The
user application on the right can use any package, and in rare cases
directly access the hardware registers.
